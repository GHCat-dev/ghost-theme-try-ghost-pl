# gatsby-theme-try-ghost
Gatsby static web app served from headless Ghost CMS

## Project goals
- [x] Ghost should serve as headless CMS

- [x] Ghost Casper v3 look and feel
- [x] Casper v3 features like *Sticky Nav Title*, [*Gallery Card*, *Infinite Scroll*] should be supported
- [ ] PrismJS support
- [ ] Lazy image loading support
- [ ] Lighthouse score \~400
- [ ] JS Widget support

## Additions
- [ ] Contact Page

## Not supported
- [x] No additions that go beyond the Ghost default Casper v3 theme
- [x] Dynamic functions, that are not easily replicated on a *static site* will be omitted (e.g. no members areas/functions)
- [x] Features that need solutions in upstream repositories, will have to wait until those solutions are available
