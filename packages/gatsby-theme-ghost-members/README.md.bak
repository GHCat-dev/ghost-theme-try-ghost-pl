Adds a membership subscription form to [gatsby-theme-try-ghost](https://github.com/styxlab/gatsby-theme-try-ghost/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-try-ghost). This plugin interacts directly with your headless Ghost CMS. After submitting an email address via the subscription form, a magic link for membership activation is sent to that inbox. If that link is clicked, the user is registered as a member in your Ghost CMS dashboard.

## Install

`yarn add gatsby-theme-ghost-members`


## Dependencies

This theme is an add-on theme designed to seamlessly integrate with [gatsby-theme-try-ghost](https://github.com/styxlab/gatsby-theme-try-ghost/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-try-ghost). The theme uses functions provided by `gatsby-theme-try-ghost`, so installing `gatsby-theme-try-ghost` is required.

`yarn add gatsby-theme-try-ghost`

## How to use

```javascript
// In your gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
    {
        resolve: `gatsby-theme-ghost-members`,
    },
]
```

## Details

This is the first plugin that brings Ghost Membership functionality to your Gatsby site! With this plugin, you can utilize your headless Ghost CMS for managing your memebers, thus no additional back-end is needed.

With this plugin a subscription form is shown at the end of every post with an email input field and a submit button. Once a user submits an email, a `POST` request is issued to your headless Ghost CMS containing the email as payload. This triggers your CMS to send out an email to that address containg a magic link for membership subscription. That link contains a unique signup token. Once clicked a `GET` request to your CMS is made, and that email address is added to your Ghost membership dashboard.

A final `GET` request from Ghost CMS is fired which opens your Ghost site and displays a success message. As this request. also points to your CMS, you should use your reverse proxy to forward this request to your static site. That ways, the user will see the success message where it belongs: On the very same site mebership subscription had been initiated.


## Ghost CMS configuration

You must active the members dashboard in Ghost Admin. Go to _Labs_ and activate the _Enable members_ section. In addition, ensure that the email configuration is set up correctly. You can test that by clicking on the _Send_ button under _Labs -> Test email configuration_.

## Nginx Configuration (optional)

If you host your headless Ghost CMS yourself, it is strongly recommended to make a small configuration change to your reverse proxy. With this, the user will be redirected to your Gatsby site after clicking on the magic link:

```text
// /etc/nginx/conf.d/cms-ghost.conf

server {

    server_name cms.your-backend.com;

    if ($args ~* "^action=subscribe&success=") {
        return 301 $scheme://www.gatsby-frontend.com$request_uri;
    }
}

```

You have to substitute `www.gatsby-frontend.com` with the address of your static site. Otherwise your users may get confused: After cklicking the magic link, they will see the private login screen of your CMS.
