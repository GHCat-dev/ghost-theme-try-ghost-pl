Adds a Table of Contentd (ToC) box to posts. This theme makes use of component shadowing and showcases best practices for adding custom themes to `gatsby-theme-try-ghost`.

## Install

## Dependencies

Its also required to install [gatsby-transformer-rehype](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-rehype/) as it provides the underlying ToC data.

`yarn add gatsby-theme-try-ghost gatsby-transformer-rehype`

## How to use

```javascript
// In your gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
    {
        resolve: `gatsby-theme-ghost-toc`,
        options: {
            // Number of shown headline levels (optional, default: 2)
            maxDepth: 2,
        },
    },
]
```

Make sure to respect the following order of plugins: gatsby-theme-try-ghost, gatsby-theme-dark-mode (if used), gatsby-transformer-rehype, gatsby-theme-ghost-toc.


## Details

This Gatsby theme plugin hooks into the `gatsby-theme-try-ghost` theme and adds a Table of Contents (Toc) box to posts. This plugin is responsibel for the visual part. On small screens, the ToC is placed directly under the feature image and before the main content. On large screens (desktops), the Toc is moved to the right hand side and is made sticky, so it can be used to navigate through the document.

The underlying ToC data is generated by gatsby-transformer-rehype, and put into the GraphQL store and passed on to this plugin. See the readme of gatsby-transformer-rehype for further details.
